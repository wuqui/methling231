- General principles
    - keep it simple, both in terms of planning and tools
    - almost any system can work for you, as long as it's a system and you use it and stick to it consistently
- setting SMART goals
- Managing todos
    - include all your TODOs
        - from other projects/jobs
        - from private commitments
    - every todo item
        - should be *actionable*
        - should have a *date*
            - *scheduled*: when are you planning to start working on it?
            - *deadline*" when does this need to be finished?
    - make a plan
        - make a weekly plan (with time slots)
        - make a daily plan (with times slots)
    - *review* your days, weeks, months, year
    - prioritise and your productive time to work on important tasks

        - Pareto's law
            - 20 % of actions can give you 80 % of the results.
            - The remaining 20 % will require 80 % of the time.
    - tools
        - pen and paper
