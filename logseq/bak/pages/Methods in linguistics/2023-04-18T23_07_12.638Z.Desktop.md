* Course description
** This course will guide you through the entire process of designing a research project in linguistics, from identifying a [[topic]] to presenting a research project proposal in written form (e.g. for a term paper, your BA thesis or Zulassungsarbeit).
** You will be offered practical advice on:
*** planning and organising your work
*** identifying and narrowing a [[topic]]
*** developing and refining [[research questions and hypotheses]]
*** finding and managing background information and [[references][literature]]
*** effective and sustainable [[note-taking]]
*** referencing [[references][literature]] and avoiding plagiarism
*** collecting and analysing [[data]] using various [[methods]] (e.g. [[corpus linguistics][corpora]], [[questionnaire][surveys]])
*** reporting results and academic [[writing]]
** For every topic, I will provide basic material and questions for discussion.
** We will work on and discuss your project ideas, and you will have the chance to present your projects to get constructive feedback.
** We will have weekly sessions in person during regular course time.
