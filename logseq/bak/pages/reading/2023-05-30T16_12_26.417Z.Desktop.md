- # What to read for your project?
	- start with **general introductions** giving you the broader picture
	- **narrow down** your reading to more specific articles, focussing on individual theoretical concepts
	- with each reading refine your **keyword list** to gradually cover the whole research area
	- if you're unsure about the relevance of a text, **skim**: read the abstract, table of contents or index and check for notions that seem to relate to your topic
	- make sure to include the **latest publications** on your topic
	- once you get the same sources in the reference section of the texts you read over and over again and no new relevant publications can be found, your reading list has reached the **saturation point**
- # How to read?
	- Different modes of reading - choose the mode that fits your aim(s):
		- **scanning**: quick reading, looking for key words)
		- **skimming** (cross-reading of the whole text; identification of passages to be read more closely later on
		- **selective reading** (reading only those passages of the text relevant to your topic; the table of contents and/or the index can help you identify relevant passages) or with an eletronic source use the search function and look for keywords
		- *close reading* (careful and critical reading of the full text; usually involves taking notes, highlighting, commenting etc.; develop a system that works for you and use it consistently)
		- *creative reading* (reading with an open mind for inspiration of own ideas)
		- maybe except for the last type, you should always make notes while reading
- # Reading and [[writing]]
  collapsed:: true
	- Reading with a specific topic in mind is always tightly linked to writing. For core texts it is advisable to produce an excerpt, so that you do not only rewrite the original text, but process the information contained in the literature, formulate it in your own words and adjust it to your topic.
	- ## First reading
	  collapsed:: true
		- get a general picture and an outline of the text; note down the structure (headings, chapters, sections, paragraphs) on a piece of paper (index cards or first page of a computer file), indicate parts of the text you definitely don‘t need
	- ## Second reading
	  collapsed:: true
		- Topic of each chapter, section, paragraph
		- Summary of each chapter, section, paragraph ...
		- Names of important researchers, further reading ...
		- Note down possible quotations (indicate pages and page break in the quotation)
		- Note down helpful examples, indicate relevant pictures, diagrams …
		- Summarize aspects that are relevant to your own work, mark potential links to your RQs or to chapters in your table of contents
		- Make notes to yourself indicating questions, unclear explanations, links to other texts you've read
- # Highlighting and marking
  collapsed:: true
	- You can also directly work with a photocopy or a PDF of the text and highlight and mark all necessary information and thus prepare a commented version.
	- Read with a system of colours to work out the structure of the text
	- Highlight names of authors and researchers, definitions, examples and possible quotations in different ways
	- Comment on the margin with keywords, paraphrases, summaries, etc.
	- Cross out passages that are not important for your work
	- Additionally, use post-its, for notes to yourself indicating cross-references to other texts, own ideas, and problematic passages

	- If you have the feeling that you don't understand what you're reading or that you cannot make sense of it, check the following issues:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Make sure you have the necessary theoretical background for the text  – if not, go back to a more general, introductory text.
		- Try to briefly sum up what you have read after a few sentences
		- Try to read with a specific question in mind in order to get an answer from the text – if 2 or 3 do not work, re-read the passage, read it aloud
		- Highlight and colour-code relevant notions (see Step 3 above)
		- Ask questions
		  collapsed:: true
			- What does the author want to show?
			- Is there a particular question behind this passage?
			- Why is the passage relevant?
			- Is it relevant for my topic?
			- What do I learn from this?
- # Critical evaluation
  collapsed:: true
	- [[Cottrell2013StudySkills]]: 187–196
	- find and evaluate the line of reasoning - is the information relevant to the topic, logical, understandable, not circular?
	- does the text have a logical structure?
	- are aspects explained before they are applied?
	- is there evidence to support the claims, is it appropriate and reliable, are any relevant issues missing?
	- do the conclusions make sense, are they clearly stated and well thought through?
	- does the evidence support the conclusions?
