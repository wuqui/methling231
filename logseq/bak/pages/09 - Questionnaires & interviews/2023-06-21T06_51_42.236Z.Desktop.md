		- microlinguistic studies vs. macrolinguistic studies
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Microlinguistics**, focuses on the small-scale or micro aspects of language.
			  collapsed:: true
				- This branch of linguistics is concerned with the **details of language structure** and use at the level of sounds (phonetics and phonology), words (morphology), sentences (syntax), and meaning (semantics). Microlinguistics also includes the study of pragmatics, which examines how context influences the interpretation of meaning.
				- The primary focus of microlinguistics is on the **individual speaker** and the **intricacies** of the language itself.
			- **Macrolinguistics**, on the other hand, is a term used to refer to the study of language in a broader or macro context.
			  collapsed:: true
				- This branch of linguistics looks at language in relation to other **sociocultural phenomena**.
				- It includes fields such as
					- **sociolinguistics** (how language varies and changes in social groups),
					- **psycholinguistics** (how language is processed in the mind),
					- **neurolinguistics** (how language is processed in the brain),
					- **anthropological linguistics** (how language reflects culture).
				- Macrolinguistics also involves the study of **language policy**, **language planning**, and other language-related issues at the societal or institutional level.

- # [[interviews]]
	- **Preparation**
		- Before conducting the interview, it's important to have a clear understanding of the research objectives. This will guide the development of the interview questions. It's also important to familiarize yourself with the interviewee's background, if possible, to tailor the questions accordingly.
	- **Building Rapport**: At the beginning of the interview, spend some time building rapport with the interviewee. This can help them feel more comfortable and open during the interview.
	- **Open-Ended Questions**: Use open-ended questions to encourage the interviewee to provide detailed responses. This can provide richer data for analysis.
	- **Active Listening**: During the interview, practice active listening. This involves fully focusing on the interviewee, avoiding interruptions, and providing feedback to show understanding.
	- **Probing**: If an interviewee's response is unclear or you need more information, use probing questions. These are follow-up questions that ask for more detail.
	- **Recording and Transcribing**: It's important to record the interview (with the interviewee's permission) and transcribe it afterwards. This ensures that you have an accurate record of what was said.
	- **Analysis**: After the interview, analyze the responses in the context of your research objectives. Look for patterns, themes, and interesting insights.
	- **Ethics**: Always ensure that the interview process respects the rights and privacy of the interviewees. Obtain informed consent, ensure confidentiality, and use the data responsibly.
