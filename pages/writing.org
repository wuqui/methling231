** *Phase I*: before you even start, write a proposal/abstract/summary of your ideas, main hypotheses, your research diary
** *Phase II*: write while you read
** *Phase III*: start writing proper with an easy chapter, then go on to the more difficult ones
** *Phase IV*: revise completed chapters - always check your chapters against your table of contents and if necessary rearrange
** *Phase V*: write Introduction and Conclusion (also other technical parts like appendix, bibliography etc.)
** *Phase VI*: revise the complete text - check for coherence ('roter Fadenâ€™) once again
** *Phase VII*: have your text proof-read by a friend and/or a native speaker
** *Phase VIII*: work in corrections and comments and make a final draft, print it and proof-read it a last time

*** includes chapters on methods, material
*** mostly ends with a chapter on the results of the study and an interpretation
** Conclusion
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: true

Or transform your excerpts for a chapter into a coherent text.
