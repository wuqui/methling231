- What do I want to learn about in this course?
	- Different research methods - how to professionally structure my work
- Which project do I want to apply the methods to?
	- My [[Linguistic Landscapes]] course and, eventually,
	- my [[Bachelors thesis]] (also smaller fun/side projects)
- What is the paper for?
	- [[term paper]]
- for which course?
	- [[Linguistic Landscapes]]
		- course topic? Linguistic Landscapes - representations of (mostly written) language in the public space (often urban)
	- course lecturer? Dr. [[Ulrike Krischke]]
	- thesis: BA, MA? n/a
		- supervisor? n/a
- Which topic (area) do I want to work on?
	- Linguistic Landscapes and how they are influenced by the ethnographically distinct areas they occur in.
- Which [[research questions]] and [[hypothesis]] do I want to work on?
	- In observing three, [[ethnographically]] distinct, parts of town in Stellenbosch, South Africa, which language(s) is/are most pervasive in their respective linguistic landscapes?
	- perhaps be able to reveal the linguistic tendencies of a less permanent settlement, tendencies of tourism areas and those of university -> does all the data I collect match up with uinversity policy (new rules regarding Afrikaans at Maties), demographic data of informal settlemet (Xhosa) and tourism (we'd probably expect English to be most dominant, in spite of Afrikaans as dominant language - demographic data 2011)
- Which [[data]] could I use?
	- [[Google street view]] sceenshots (supplemented by photos taken of residents) of three different parts of town in Stellenbosch, South Africa
		- main tourist hub/historical old town (Church or Dorp Street)
		- university district (surrounding the Neelsie, Endler and the university library)
		- (more or less) informal settlement/township (Kayamandi)
	- Analysis
		- (how many signs are there)
		- which languages apear on signs
		- which language appears most often
		- [[top-down]] or [[bottom-up]] configurations and whether there is a significant difference between language(s) on either
		- which [[domains]] do specific languages occur in most often
- Which [[methods]] could I use?
	- [[qualitative analysis]]
	- [[quantitative analysis]]
	- [[demographic data]]
	- [[language policy]]
	- research (historical, political, ... factors)
